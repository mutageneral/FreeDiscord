FreeDiscord is a Discord bot made by the FreeTechnologies team ([SKBotNL](https://github.com/SKBotNL), [ItsJustLag](https://github.com/ItsJustLag), [recallwhoiam](https://github.com/recallwhoiam), and [Odysseus](https://github.com/Odysseus443)) that you can edit and self host. This bot is 100% open source, so feel free to make forks of it, if you want.
If you find an issue, or have a feature suggestion, please let us know by opening an issue [here](https://github.com/FreeTechnologies/FreeDiscord/issues). :)

Also, if you do not like the credit that gets given when using `@help`, you may remove the Discord server link only.

## Documentation

### Starting the bot

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/FreeTechnologies/FreeDiscord.git`
2. `cd` to the repository folder: `cd FreeDiscord`
3. Add your Discord bot token at the bottom of `bot.py` where it asks for your token (`bot.run('Insert your bot token here')`)

### Features

There are many features of the bot. These features include:

- VirusTotal file scanning (see below)
- Message encryption
- Moderation
- Lots more
- More being added regularly :)

For the VirusTotal file scanning to work, you need to get a VirusTotal V3 API key. 
To get this, sign in to VirusTotal and get the API key, then put it where it says:
`#Put a VirusTotal API key within the quote down below.
apikey = "API_KEY_HERE"`

Like earlier said, if you have any feature requests or issues with the bot, open an issue [here](https://github.com/FreeTechnologies/FreeDiscord/issues)!
Enjoy the bot! We hope you have as much fun with it as we had programming it! :)
